# Final Project Proposal - Alan Ranciato

1) Type of app

    This will be a DApp.  I plan to implement with a javascript front end, but due to limited experience with it, may stick to Jupyter (will definitely do a notebook to test and submit along side.)

2) Main Idea

    DApp for managing a golf tournament and prizes. Will calculate different games (skins, closest to the pin, etc) and payouts in coin (GOLF coin is already in existance.  Might need to come up with something else via ICO, or accept multiple forms of payment / coins)

3) Potential Market

    Golfers and gamers.  The intent is to use for small tournaments and golf trips between friends, but could see it as being a service offered and take a "house percentage".

4) Logistics

    Contract written in Solidity.  Jupyter Notebook for testing and Demo.  Potentially - web front-end interface.  Will likely demo with jupyter via Youtube so I can show the outcomes of the data as well.  Testing via Remix. Requirements (just so I don't forget about functions) via UML sequence.

5) Last Mile Problem

    Biggest issue is the oracle problem. The data entry will likely always be manual as it's golf and not a sanctioned professional event. In order to solve - will build in capability to specify the number of votes needed for consensus.

6) Scaling issues

    I don't know that scaling would be too big of an issue.  Obviously managing the front-end capacity would be a thing.  Nothing should be too time sensitive.  I think the biggest issue could be a rise in cost of gas for the blockchain and pricing out usage.

7) Fraud and Malicious behavior

    Inputting incorrect scores could be an issue - hence the reason for consensus and the ability to update.  Also, as golfers are not traditionally the most technical of people, I can see kay management being an issue.

8) Compare without blockchain

    The solution could definitley be done without blockchain as a centralized service.  I think what blockchain provides is the ability to manage contracts and tournaments yourself vs relying on a service.  Additionally, the gambling aspect is now just a friendly game between friends vs. a centralized service that might be regulated.
