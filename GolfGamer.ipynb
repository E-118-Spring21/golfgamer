    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project is a golf contest wagering contract to be used for small to large groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contract tracks multiple players, their number of skins and CTPs (closest to the pin) won as well as their total scores for multiple rounds of golf.  After requiring a buyin from each player, the contract calculates the pro-rated payout per contest for each player, calculates a commission (to pay for both gas and administration), and provides payouts to the players and the owner of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, the contract allows for changing the percentage of payout for each game, the number of score attestations needed to finalize the game, and the ability to see scores and contest standings along the way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, when the withdraw() function is called, final payouts are calculated (total won - commission), players are all paid, the contract remaining balance is paid to the owner of the contract and events are emited to the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to run and validate the contract are illustrated below\n"

    "###  Copy of the Final Project Proposal \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Type of app\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a DApp.  I plan to implement with a javascript front end, but due to limited experience with it, may stick to Jupyter (will definitely do a notebook to test and submit along side.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "DApp for managing a golf tournament and prizes. Will calculate different games (skins, closest to the pin, etc) and payouts in coin (GOLF coin is already in existance.  Might need to come up with something else via ICO, or accept multiple forms of payment / coins)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Potential Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Golfers and gamers.  The intent is to use for small tournaments and golf trips between friends, but could see it as being a service offered and take a \"house percentage\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Contract written in Solidity.  Jupyter Notebook for testing and Demo.  Potentially - web front-end interface.  Will likely demo with jupyter via Youtube so I can show the outcomes of the data as well.  Testing via Remix. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Last Mile Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Biggest issue is the oracle problem. The data entry will likely always be manual as it's golf and not a sanctioned professional event. In order to solve - will build in capability to specify the number of votes needed for consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Scaling issues\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know that scaling would be too big of an issue.  Obviously managing the front-end capacity would be a thing.  Nothing should be too time sensitive.  I think the biggest issue could be a rise in cost of gas for the blockchain and pricing out usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Fraud and Malicious behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputting incorrect scores could be an issue - hence the reason for consensus and the ability to update.  Also, as golfers are not traditionally the most technical of people, I can see kay management being an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Compare without blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution could definitley be done without blockchain as a centralized service.  I think what blockchain provides is the ability to manage contracts and tournaments yourself vs relying on a service.  Additionally, the gambling aspect is now just a friendly game between friends vs. a centralized service that might be regulated.  \n",
